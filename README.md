## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```
$ npm install --save react-utilities
or
$ yarn add react-utilities
```

Then with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else.

```js
// using ES6 modules
import {Delegate, Resolve, Debounce, Throttle} from 'react-utilities'

// or
import Resolve from 'react-utilities/Resolve'

// using CommonJS modules
var Delegate = require('react-utilities').Delegate
```

## Overview

### Resolve
  `Resolve` is a react component which resolve `promise` and pass the resolved value to children component when promise return. With `Resolve` you can wrap your pure, stateless component to connect them to remote data.
  
```jsx
<Resolve name='user' promise={fetchUser(id)}>
  <User />
</Resolve>
// after fetch data `{id:1,name:'alice'}` it would render
<User user={{id:1,name:'alice'}} /> 
```

### Delegate
  `Delegate` is a component delegate rendering to other component.
  
  

### Debounce
  `Debounce` is a react component to [`debounce`](https://lodash.com/docs#debounce) certain properties to children component. So children component will render less  frequently(if you make it pure).


### Throttle
  `Throttle` is a react component to [`throttle`](https://lodash.com/docs#throttle) certain properties to children component. So children component will render less  frequently(if you make it pure).
